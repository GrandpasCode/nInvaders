	* nInvaders.h, player.c: updated every occurance of hit_player_test
	to hit_alientest

	* nInvaders.c (hit_alien_test): renamed from 'hit_player_test'

2003-04-05 Alexander Hollinger <alexander.hollinger@gmx.net>

	* [view.c] (bunkersDisplay): now fully encapsulated using pointer 
	  *pBunker to get access to bunker-array. Method is called from 
	  [aliens.c] (bunkersReset) instead of [aliens.c] (render) thus 
	  saving some cpu-time. The bunker has to be displayed only at the 
	  beginning of a new level. Then we use bunkerClearElement or 
	  bunkerClear to remove bunker elements. No need why it was in 
	  [aliens.c] (render).

	* nInvaders.c (readInput): draw new number of lives in live-cheat

	* aliens.c (aliensReset): put declaration of 'level' at
	beginning of function

2003-04-04 Alexander Hollinger <alexander.hollinger@gmx.net>

	* [nInvaders.c] added a new cheat: "L" gives player one new life
	  for better testing
	* [aliens.c, player.c] (*Reset) forgot to reset alien-block and 
	  bunkers-block. Now there is a bunkersReset in aliens.c
	* [view.c] added method graphicEngineInit()
	* [view.c] (refreshScreen) fixed problem with graphic display on some 
	  terminals. bunker and player are now displayed at startup.  
	* removed init.c and init.h from project 
	* [globals.c] some minor changes to names of methods. moved code for 
	  displaying version from nInvaders.c to globals.c. Added code to 
	  redefine usleep for WIN32-platforms, this should hopefully fix the
	  bug that the game was too fast there.

2003-04-03 Alexander Hollinger <alexander.hollinger@gmx.net>
	
	* removed deprecated multi-line-strings in globals.c and nInvaders.c

2003-04-02 Alexander Hollinger <alexander.hollinger@gmx.net>

	* view.c now contains all methods which do graphical display
	  (by using ncurses)
	  
	* added file aliens.c and aliens.h. Perhaps these can later melt
	  with player.c and player.h.

2003-04-01  Sebastian Gutsfeld  <segoh@gmx.net>

	* *.c (*): formatted with 'indent -kr -i8 -l90' and fixed
	some linebreaks

2003-03-30 Alexander Hollinger <alexander.hollinger@gmx.net>

	* added file "ToDo": put feature-requests and alike in here

	* player.c (player*Missile*): processing of missiles moved to these
	functions to reduce size of main().


2003-03-29  Sebastian Gutsfeld  <segoh@gmx.net>

	* init.c (initplayer): fixed comment

	* player.c (playerInit): put declaration of 'playerSprite' at beginning

	functions concearning the player
